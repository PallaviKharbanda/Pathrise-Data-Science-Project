## Pathrise-Data-Science-Project

This project aims to analyze the effectiveness of Pathrise Admission process and  making recommendations for improvement.
The two main business problems targeted are whether a fellow will be placed at pathrise and how long the placement can be done.

### Methodolgy
 Step 1 : Import the libraries and dataset

 Step 2 : See DataFrame and show basic info and statistical interference about the dataset

 Step 3:  Check out the missing values and handle it

 Step 4 : See the Categorical Values and handle it

 Step 5 : Findout independent and dependent variable for Problem Statements 1 and 2 under consideration

 Step 6 : Splitting the dataset into Training and Test Set

 Step 7 : Model Building

 Step 8 : Model Evaluation
    
 Step 9 : Model Deployment 
    
 Step 10 : Conclusion

### Conclusion 
The model predicts that out of 1506 candidates who are either active or have/had continued enrollement with pathrise, 1490 candidates will get/would have been placed ultimately at a company based on their attributes.
Also, we conclude that 70% fellows are placed in first 6 months of their enrollment (35% in first three months, 35% in 3-6 months).
A very less percentage(0.008) of candidates will take more than an year to get placed. Hence we can easily conclude that Pathrise is doing well in placement of 
fellows. And we can highly recommend anyone looking for a placement to join pathrise

### Recommendations

Fellows at Pathrise whose status is MIA, Break, Deferred should be encouraged to get back in action by offering some Lucrative offers.
Also, Fellows at Pathrise whose status is Withdrawn(Trial), Withdrawn, Closed Lost who are not in any contract with Pathrise should be urged to enroll and 
accept their offer by relaxing some contract conditions.
